This repo stores my small C projects, acting as a way to track my progress and ability.

As of the last commit, the repo contains:
- WaterMelon Algo: A 2D DFS visualiser, where a robot blindly explores a 2D map to capture 'markers', finishing after its done. It also has the option for the user to initiliase parameters through command line arguments, such as map size, robot speed, and position.
